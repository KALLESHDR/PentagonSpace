    <h3>About US:</h3>
    <p>An About Us page isn’t just where you share the story of your brand. It’s also where you tell your customer what you do for them and how you work to meet their needs in that area. It isn’t so much “Here’s what we’re about,” but more like “Here’s who
        we are, why we started, and what we can do for you.”</p>

An About Us page can include a wide array of information, but the most common sections to include are:

Who you serve and what you do for them.
Your brand story/history, including how you got started.
Your mission and vision for the company.
Your brand values, what you believe in, and how you uphold those values in your day-to-day operations.
Mini bios of the people on your team.
An explanation of your process, how your services work, or how your products are made.
